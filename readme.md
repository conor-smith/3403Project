# Pair Up!

A simple flask app for allocating student pairs in the [CITS3403 project](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/index.php?fname=projects&project=yes).

## Getting Started

Activate the python virtual environment:
`$source virtual-environment/bin/activate`

To run the app:
`$flask run`

To stop the app:
`$^C`

To exit the environment:
`$deactivate`

### Prerequisites

Requires python3, flask, venv, and sqlite

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Install python3, sqlite3

1. Set up a virtual environment:
 - use pip or another package manager to install virtualenv package `pip install virtualenv`
 - start the provided virtual environment
   `source virtual-environment/bin/activate`
 - This should include flask and all the required packages
2. Install sqlite
 - [Windows instructions](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/)
 - In \*nix, `sudo apt-get install sqlite`
3. Build the database: `flask db init`
4. `flask run`

This should start the app running on localhost at port 5000, i.e. [http://localhost:5000/index](http://localhost:5000/index)
