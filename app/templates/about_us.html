  <p>
    We are a website dedicated to determining the best and worst of all Hollywood has to offer. We do this
    through allowing the people to vote on these movies. Log in every Monday for 6 new polls to participate in.
    This website was built by a small independant company consisting of only 2 people: Conor Smith and Billtone Meyoum
    We were both sick of Hollywoodonly representing the words of the critics when it came to ratings, and not including
    the words of the common folk like you and me. So, this website is a way of showing them that we the people decide what's
    best. No Oscars or Golden Globes have any effect here, only the opinions of the masses

    <p>
      Every time you vote on a movie in a poll, you assign it a score from 1 to the amount of movies in the poll.
      All the scores of all participants are then combined to produce the global results.
